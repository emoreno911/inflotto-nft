# Inflotto

The Lottery of Inflation, a dApp to combine the Truflation's inflation index, Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Keepers. In Inflotto you can buy tickets with an amount of MATIC and it will generate an NFT with a random inflation index for the weekly draw, at the end of the week the holder of the NFT ticket with the closest number to that day's inflation rate will win the pool.

It's made with ReactJS and Moralis API working Polygon Testnet. It's also using the Finity design system, implemented with Tailwind.
